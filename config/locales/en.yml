# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization
# and are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other
# than English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#
# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t 'hello'
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t('hello') %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.
#
# To learn more, please read the Rails Internationalization guide
# available at http://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html.

          However you found yourself here, Welcome! If you're an existing member, %{link:please log in here}, or if
          you're new, we've arranged a few points of interest about CWS here:
        points:
          what: '%{b:What} is CWS?'
          more: '%{b:What} sort of things do you have/do?'
          how: '%{b:How} do I join?'
          why: '%{b:Why} does CWS exist?'
      points:
        what:
          title: What is CWS?
          paragraph1: >
            CWS, or %{u:C}on%{u:W}ork%{u:S}hop, is a conlanging community and tools website started in early 2014 aimed
            at providing the tools and community to help you strive in your conlanging endeavours. We are a very
            eclectic group of people who are enthusiastic about conlangs and concultures. We have teenagers, students,
            professionals, and so on - everyone is welcome.
          paragraph2: >
            It is %{b:completely free of charge} and will always remain so. It is a community built by conlangers, for
            conlangers. We are always aiming to update our tools to give you the largest range of choices possible, and
            we have a very helpful staff team who will help us achieve that goal.
          paragraph3: >
            CWS is largely geared towards conlangers with a working knowledge of language and linguistics, however we do
            invite everyone to join! We have a good base of members with an infinite wealth of knowledge, and we're here
            to help.

          title: What sort of things do you have/do?
          text: >
            Where do we start?! The site is broken up into three main sections: the %{lib:Library}, the %{tools:Tools},
            and the %{com:Community}. (and yes, they're colour-coded :D)
          library:
            title: Library
            text: >
              The library is your centre of language creation. There's a highly detailed dictionary to store your
              lexicon, to search, edit, import and export your lexicon. There are grammar tables that automatically
              conjugate entries based on rules, there are phonologies, and orthographies, and more! Some examples of
              some things from the creator's language (Nithalos) can be seen here:
            list:
              summary: Sample language summary page
              word: Sample word entry
              text: '%{link:Sample translated text} (Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Article 1)'
              article: Sample language article
          tools:
            title: Tools
            text: >
              The tools section contains everything from word generators, to word banks, to lexical field vocabulary
              sets (we call these "LexiBuild"), %{link:our conlanger's Swadesh List}, and much more!
          community:
            title: Community
            text: >
              The community is where the people and languages come together. We have a bunch of clans for varied
              interests, active discussion boards with games, challenges, month-long events, and more!
          events:
            title: Events
            text: >
              CWS has a number of events - usually a month long that run throughout the year to help inspire and
              motivate your language building. Check out %{link:the overview of our events} for more information.
          projects:
            title: Projects
            text: 'At CWS, we love doing projects, like %{link:this beautiful thing}.'
        how:
          title: How do I join?
          paragraph1: >
            We're glad you've read this far! There are two ways you can join us. Firstly, you can login using your
            Facebook account. Don't worry, the only information we use is your name and your profile picture. If you're
            concerned about privacy, you can %{link:read our privacy information}.
          paragraph2: >
            Alternatively, you can create a %{link:standard login account}, you know, the kind with email address and
            password. Don't worry, we don't share this information either.
          paragraph3: 'Once you have an account, you can %{link:login to CWS} to be part of it.'
        why:
          title: Why does CWS exist?
          paragraph1: >
            If you're interested to know, it was born out of the idea that conlangers and conlang tools are found all
            over the internet, and we wanted a place to centralise these in order to create one single place to go for
            everything.
          paragraph2: >
            CWS's integrated model also means you have the ability to do more with your language as we not only have your
            lexicon, but your grammar, your phonology, your orthography, and this means these elements can interact in
            ways that other sites may not be able to. Because CWS was created by conlangers, for conlangers, it will
            always be free. We aren't professionals at this, so sometimes patience is appreciated, but it's worth the
            wait. We also welcome feedback and suggestions to improve the site, and without those we've already
            received, who knows what opportunities we might have missed.
          paragraph3: >
            CWS can also be found on Social Media if you have the urge to follow or like us there. See the site footer
            for the links!
